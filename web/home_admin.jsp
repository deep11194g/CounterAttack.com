            <center>Welcome to <span class="ib">your</span> site. Yes. This is your site.</center>
            </p>
            <p>
            More than once you have your opinion about football: "the team played pathetically", "what was the manager thinking when he bought this player", or even " this kit sucks!" But where to share your opinion?
            </p>
            <p>
            This the the place to be.
            </p>
            <p>
            Submit your articles, participate in the debates, raise questions. <span class="b">Make your voice heard!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            But there's a small catch. Everything is moderated. You're encouraged to post your opinion. Not enforce it. You can't just say you hate a team just because "<span class="i">they're bad</span>". Criticize. But with a little class.
            </p>
