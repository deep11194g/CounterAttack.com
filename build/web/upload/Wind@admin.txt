Widnows8 evaluation:          
Microsoft has finally released the Windows 8 Consumer Preview. Though still in its beta stage, we can draw a picture of what the final product is going to be. According to Steven Sinofsky, President of Microsoft’s Windows Business division, Windows 8 is a “generational change” of the Windows operating system. The last time windows had a generational change was Windows 95. It’s a huge radical rethinking of Windows — and one that’s beautiful, logical and simple.
