Wilson: Dynasty beckons for Bayern


FOX Sports columnist Jonathan Wilson believes Saturday's UEFA Champions League triumph could spell the start of something special for Bayern Munich.

There has been much giddy talk of a new era of German dominance and it can hardly be disputed that Germany has got much right. The academy system, instituted in 1999, has been a triumph, as a glance at the national side makes clear, and it is surely a positive that the percentage of foreign players in the Bundesliga has fallen from 60 per cent in 2002 to 47 per cent today: there is space for young German talent to develop. But history suggests that providing both finalists in the Champions League is no guarantee of future success. This was the fourth one-nation final since 2000 and none of the others - Real Madrid vs Valencia in 2000, AC Milan vs Juventus in 2003 and Manchester United vs Chelsea in 2008 - have led to a period of prolonged dominance. 

Rather this was a contest between one of the new group of around half a dozen superclubs and another team from the second rank of wealth who happened to come from the same country. There may have been only an 89th-minute goal between the sides in the final at Wembley, but in financial terms there is a vast gulf.

Bayern Munich's wage bill is slightly more than double that of Borussia Dortmund and they have already signed one of their best players for next season in Mario Gotze. Another, Robert Lewandowski, may yet follow - "he will not be hanging around," said Heynckes. For Dortmund, reaching the final is an astonishing achievement but it is hard to believe they will do so again any time soon. Economics will win out: it's impossible for the likes of Dortmund to keep selling and keep regenerating, however clever they have been so far. One mistake and any semblance of challenge the elite will collapse. As if to symbolise the victory of capital, this is the first time in history that Germany has won more European Cups than the Netherlands.

The energy and enthusiasm of Jurgen Klopp has been one of the features of this Champions League season, but even he seemed weary as he spoke of his pride in his side and contemplated the task ahead. "We have to buy players because other clubs want our players and then we have to start again," he said. "Next week I have a lot of work to build a new team."

That Bayern are the best side in Europe at the moment can hardly be disputed. They comfortably beat the champions of Italy and Spain on their way to the final and then beat a side they'd already finished 25 points clear of in the league. Their football frequently sparkles. They press superbly, move intelligently and pass with great accuracy and invention. But there is a dark side. Too many of their players go down too easily, looking for free-kicks and feigning injury when opponents threaten to break. And at Wembley, they were extremely forward not to have two men sent off. 

Dante had been booked in the first half for a cynical foul on Marco Reus when he clattered into the midriff of Reus to concede the second-half penalty. It was a clear second yellow card and yet the Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't show it. Then Franck Ribery, having been denied a penalty when he went down easily for the umpteenth time, lashed out at Kevin Grosskreutz and should have been sent off. It's only fair to note that Robert Lewandowski also could have gone for a stamp on Jerome Boateng but it was Ribery who set up the winner, his backheel setting through Arjen Robben, who finished cleverly. But it would be misleading to suggest this was some kind of injustice. After an awkward opening quarter, Bayern were the better side.

For Jupp Heynckes this was the perfect end-off. His side will complete a treble if they beat Stuttgart on the German Cup final next Saturday and then he will leave, having been retired. Pep Guardiola will arrive and his task, rather than being to take Bayern the final steps to glory, as seemed likely to be the case, will be to sustain a position of dominance. Even Klopp spoke of being "pleased" for Heyneckes, who he said "merited" his success - he becomes only the fourth manager after Ernst Happel, Ottmar Hitzfeld and Jose Mourinho to win the cpmpetition with two different teams. Heynckes insisted that, contrary to German media reports, he had gone voluntarily, but as he spoke about deferring celebrations until after next Saturday's German Cup final, it was clear that he wants to bid farewell with a treble.

It seems harsh on Heynckes, disposed of for the second time after winning a European Cup, but for Bayern it may be for the best. There will be pressure on Guardiola, of course, but a new manager, particularly one so vaunted and with such a distinctive style of play, should ward off the sense of complacency and lack of hunger than can so often infect sides who have won the Champions League. In terms of finances and personnel, Bayern has the foundations of a dynasty.
