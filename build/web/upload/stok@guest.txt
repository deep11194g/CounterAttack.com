Tony Pulis traded goodwill for success


Stoke City's style of play under the manager was a self-inflicted PR failure.

To discover traces of sympathy towards Tony Pulis following his departure, you'd have to go deep into Stoke-on-Trent in the heart of Staffordshire county. Outside of this English city, there has hardly been a hint of sorrow; rather, there is a palpable undercurrent of "good riddance". 
Despite taking England's second oldest club into the uncharted territories of the European game besides re-establishing it in the top division against all odds, Pulis has seen his feats with The Potters overshadowed by the manner in which they were achieved.
His seven-year long spell at the club was relatively successful. Promotion to the top tier after a gap of 23 years, a maiden runners-up finish in the FA Cup, a first ever European campaign and sustaining the club in the top flight for five seasons (never finishing below 14th) certainly exceeded expectations.
But the Welsh manager's removal did not come as a surprise. Four wins in the last 22 matches in all competitions this season was a poor return for any side, let alone one set up solely to play in a result-oriented fashion. Unlike Roberto Martinez, whose team, relegated though they were, went down with in style or Paul Lambert, who was evidently developing a young side for the long-term, Pulis had no excuses for delivering relegation form.
In the modern football landscape, there is an overwhelming appreciation for style alongside results and England has belatedly identified a need for a change in its football traditions. Stoke are the best example of an outdated culture that's loathed and in need of reformation.
If Barcelona's tiki-taka places the Catalans at one end of the spectrum of club identities, the nature of Stoke City's hoof-ball and rough tactics puts them at the other; the contrast being so wide, in fact, that former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray's comment on how he would like to see Lionel Messi perform on "a cold night at the Britannia (Stadium)" is immortalized in football folklore.
To be fair to Pulis though, when the club was promoted to the top flight, his task was to ensure survival and he did so by doing a fairly logical thing - play to the team's strengths. To put Pulis' work into perspective; Hull City, West Brom (promoted again), Wolves, Birmingham, Burnley, Blackpool, Reading and QPR have all come up and gone back down into the Championship since Stoke got promoted in 2008.
Initially, some of Stoke's distinct features such as Rory Delap's long throws, relentless aerial bombardment, loudness of the home support, performance intensity and the propensity to upset the odds were either entertaining or worth admiring. But over time, the club's pride in kicking opponents to a standstill and sticking to an unappealing brand of football resulted in the manager, among others, becoming a reviled figure among rival supporters and players.
A lack of tactical evolution and a flawed transfer policy eventually led to the manager's sacking. Stoke City's net spend since being promoted stands at just over £80 million, which is bettered only by Manchester City and Chelsea. Yet, Pulis often cited the opposition's financial muscle to deflect away from his side's performances.
His transfer strategy lacked clear vision, which is why owner Peter Coates felt the need to appoint Mark Cartwright in the technical director role last December. Coates must also have looked at clubs like Wigan, Swansea, West Brom and Southampton, which had survived while playing attractive football on much lesser budgets.
Pulis' signings had virtually no resale value and weren't young, long-term prospects either. The accumulated sum of money spent on transfers was largely on players that could, at best, be described as squad players to further Stoke's commitment to route-one football. Players such as Tuncay Sanli, who held the potential to take the club to a new level, found themselves on a different wavelength to the rest of the team. 
The manager may have attempted to evolve his side into a more progressive team with the signing of players such as Charlie Adam but evidence of significant progress was hard to find. He had also visited academies in Bilbao and Leverkusen to develop detailed future plans, but ran out of time to make changes.
Stoke averaged only 43% possession this season and finished with the worst disciplinary record. Their style of play has always been about territorial rather than ball control - hitting long balls and pushing opponents deep into their defensive half.
The club registered the least number of shots on goal (10.2 per game), completed the fewest number of dribbles (4.2 per game), recorded the worst passing accuracy (70%), scored the smallest proportion of goals from open play (41%) and attempted the second-lowest proportion of short passes (76%) in the league.
Naturally, what was lost on the ground was made up for in the air. Stoke topped the charts for aerial duels won (28.9 per game) and registered the highest proportion of long balls (17%), of set-piece goals (44%) and of goals from inside the six-yard box (11%). The club's topmost passing combination regularly involved the goalkeeper and the target man.
Pulis was never the connoisseur's choice, neither in philosophy nor in demeanour. But he did add variety to the league, forcing opposition managers to alter strategies. Rafael Benitez, for instance, once named eight defensive-minded players including six defenders in his Liverpool team sheet at the Britannia Stadium.
Considering how Charlton and Wolves fell into League One following the departures of Alan Curbishley and Mick McCarthy respectively, Stoke are likely to go through a downward spiral when transitioning from a Pulis-infused philosophy to a more modern way of football. If they do, they'll find little compassion from elsewhere.
Tony Pulis may have achieved success in his time at Stoke but his legacy will lie in uniting the rest of the football fraternity, in despising him and the club he led.
