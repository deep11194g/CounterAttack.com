Owners of Proprietary Software's closely guard their Source code, and thus cannot be modified by anyone except them.
On the contrary, Open Source software means, the source code of the software is OPEN to general public.
Programmers can read,redistribute, and modify the source for a piece of software.People adapt it, improve it and fix bugs. And this can happen at a speed that,compared to conventional software development, seems astonishing.
The term Free is in the sense, freedom to copy and re-use the software source, rather than to the price of the software.
To understand the concept, one should-
"think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer".
Though Open Source are mostly free of cost there are few exceptions like ZendStudio,houdini.
