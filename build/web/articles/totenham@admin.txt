First world problems for Tottenham

Missing out on Champions League football yet again is a first world problem Tottenham fans should be glad to have.


Blowing a seven-point lead over Arsenal was a massive disappointment for Tottenham, but it would be harsh to deem their season as a failure.
At the start of the season, the objective was clear: a repeat of last season’s top four finish was the target, but even the most hardcore fans had a modicum of doubt in their hearts.
Rewind to the beginning of August, and it’s hard not to see where the doubts arose.
Harry Redknapp, the man who brought the club out of mid-table wilderness and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League, was replaced by Andre Villas-Boas, an enigmatic young manager whose previous stint at the helm of Chelsea ended in disaster.
It wasn’t reassuring that the Portuguese inherited a rather imbalanced squad without two of their most creative players in Luka Modric and Rafael van der Vaart on their way out – both of them had been lethal spearheads for Spurs under Redknapp. 
The scenario wasn’t much brighter looking at their immediate competitors – Chelsea spent £92 million in the summer to reinforce their squad with the likes of Eden Hazard and Oscar while Everton and Newcastle emerged as contenders to push for the Europa League spot.
Uncertainty enveloped White Hart Lane before the start of the campaign – the club had the potential to sustain their push at the top, but equally, they could venture into calamitous territory. 

Now that the context of their season has been set, it provides a fairer representation of Villas-Boas’ performance at Tottenham.
As many coaches have shown, building a side up from the back is the way to success and it’s a reassuring sign that Villas-Boas’ three most expensive transfers  – Jan Vertonghen, Hugo Lloris and Moussa Dembele – were spent on shoring up the defensive core of his side instead of going all-out to sign top attacking talent (like a particular London club are wont to do).
The move paid off handsomely. Vertonghen was the best defender in the league and was named in the PFA Team of the Year while Lloris has taken over the number one spot from veteran Brad Friedel without much fuss. Dembele’s season was curtailed by injuries but he looked every bit reassuring at the core of Tottenham’s midfield whenever he played.
Add to that the return of the highly-rated youngster Steven Caulker from loan at Swansea and Michael Dawson’s escape from injury hell, Villas-Boas has actually done well to secure the defensive depth of his side.
The season itself was frustrating given how points were dropped against the likes of Fulham, QPR, Stoke, West Brom and Wigan, but it was also one marked with memorable wins like the one over Manchester United at Old Trafford (their first since 1989).
Dembele summed it up well when he said: “We are close to the top teams, and we are not close.
"Because against the top teams we are good, we think, ‘They are not better than us.’ But against the small teams we struggle, and it’s like ‘Okay, the top teams would finish this.’”
Much of the blame must be put on their attacking duo of Emmanuel Adebayor and Jermain Defoe, who took turns occupying the treatment room and failed to match their team’s ambition on the pitch.
Adebayor in particular was a huge disappointment considering that the club acceded to his wage demands to sign him. If there was a moment to sum up his season, it was his penalty miss against Basel after a ridiculous run-up that led to Spurs’ elimination from the Europa League.
If not for the heroics of a certain Gareth Bale, Tottenham would have flirted with bigger disaster.
Bale took his game to another level after a muted start to the campaign to bag the PFA Young Player of the Year, Player of the Year and FWA Player of the year awards with 21 goals – most of them astounding finishes – to his name.
The worry now is that the Welshman’s spectacular season has further whetted the desire of clubs like Real Madrid to prise him from Tottenham, but Spurs have a big factor working for them in Villas-Boas. 
Bale may have taken the spotlight with his accolades, but the Portuguese manager was the man who enabled it all – first by reigniting Bale’s flagging passion for the game, then by shifting him into the middle and building Spurs’ attack around him.
“I had Gareth knocking on my door once, not crying, but he was complaining a little bit.” Villas-Boas said, “He said he wanted me to help him to enjoy his football a little more.
“From that moment onwards his drive, his passion and his ambition towards the height of elite football has been immense and it shows through the great season he has had.
"Will the big clubs be able to lure Bale away? It is very, very difficult to lure a player of [these dimensions] away.”
Villas-Boas’ parting words at the end of the season were reassuring. The fact that he has requested a technical director to assist him and made a promise for a sane transfer window speaks of better things to come.
"We have been outlining the route ahead for what we want to do in terms of the club structures and hopefully the arrival of somebody else in the structure for the recruitment side, a technical director, so hopefully we can take those steps forward," added the Portuguese.
"We got ever so close (to the top four), but they (Manchester United, City, Chelsea and Arsenal) will do their job in the window, and we will do ours the Tottenham way: scouting properly and look for good grabs in summer window to make it a stronger squad."
Yes, it was disappointing for Tottenham to miss out on Champions League football yet again, but the signs are positive for the club – they are the first club to accumulate over 70 points and still fail to finish in the top four.
With a steady core to the side and a sensible manager at the helm, Spurs are a few signings away from becoming a truly world class side. A creative midfielder to replace Modric and a truly world-class striker to lead their attack and Tottenham could be in the reckoning for a title push next season.
